# Indoor Scenes

There are 160 categories of indoor scenes in **Places** and 67 categories in **MIT67** in total.

For **Places**, it contains both indoor and outdoor scenes. We extracted the indoor parts from the orignial dataset due to the label provided by the authors. More details about **Places** can be found [here](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/). And for MIT67, orignial data and labels can be found in [this website](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html).

The two scene-centric datasets have 57 categories in common.

In this repository, files with same number in their names indicate overlapping categories contained by both **MIT67** and **Places**. Such as [names_mit_10.txt](https://github.com/amylmy/IndoorScenes-UnsupervidedRepresentationLearning/blob/master/names_mit_10.txt) and [names_places_10.txt](https://github.com/amylmy/IndoorScenes-UnsupervidedRepresentationLearning/blob/master/names_places_10.txt) contain same 10 categories of indoor scenes. The same for [names_mit_35.txt](https://github.com/amylmy/IndoorScenes-UnsupervidedRepresentationLearning/blob/master/names_mit_35.txt) and [names_places_35.txt](https://github.com/amylmy/IndoorScenes-UnsupervidedRepresentationLearning/blob/master/names_places_35.txt), etc. 

Other details and data will be updated in the future.
